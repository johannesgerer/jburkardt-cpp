TEST_INTERP_PRB
  C++ version
  Test the TEST_INTERP library.
  This test also requires the R8LIB library.

TEST01
  P00_STORY prints the problem "story".

  Problem 1

  This example is due to Hans-Joerg Wenz.
  It is an example of good data, which is dense enough in areas
  where the expected curvature of the interpolant is large.
  Good results can be expected with almost any reasonable
  interpolation method.

  Problem 2

  This example is due to ETY Lee of Boeing.
  Data near the corners is more dense than in regions of small curvature.
  A local interpolation method will produce a more plausible
  interpolant than a nonlocal interpolation method, such as
  cubic splines.

  Problem 3

  This example is due to Fred Fritsch and Ralph Carlson.
  This data can cause problems for interpolation methods.
  There are sudden changes in direction, and at the same time,
  sparsely-placed data.  This can cause an interpolant to overshoot
  the data in a way that seems implausible.

  Problem 4

  This example is due to Larry Irvine, Samuel Marin and Philip Smith.
  This data can cause problems for interpolation methods.
  There are sudden changes in direction, and at the same time,
  sparsely-placed data.  This can cause an interpolant to overshoot
  the data in a way that seems implausible.

  Problem 5

  This example is due to Larry Irvine, Samuel Marin and Philip Smith.
  This data can cause problems for interpolation methods.
  There are sudden changes in direction, and at the same time,
  sparsely-placed data.  This can cause an interpolant to overshoot
  the data in a way that seems implausible.

  Problem 6

  The data is due to deBoor and Rice.
  The data represents a temperature dependent property of titanium.
  The data has been used extensively as an example in spline
  approximation with variably-spaced knots.
  DeBoor considers two sets of knots:
  (595,675,755,835,915,995,1075)
  and
  (595,725,850,910,975,1040,1075).

  Problem 7

  This data is a simple symmetric set of 4 points,
  for which it is interesting to develop the Shepard
  interpolants for varying values of the exponent p.

  Problem 8

  This is equally spaced data for y = x^2,
  except for one extra point whose x value is
  close to another, but whose y value is not so close.
  A small disagreement in nearby data can be disaster.

TEST02
  P00_DATA_NUM returns N, the number of data points.
  P00_DIM_NUM returns M, the dimension of data.
  P00_DATA returns the actual (MxN) data.
