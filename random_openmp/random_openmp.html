      RANDOM_OPENMP <br> Parallel Random Numbers with OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RANDOM_OPENMP</b>
      is a C++ program which
      uses random numbers during a calculation that has been parallelized with OpenMP.
    </p>

    <p>
      The random numbers are generated by a function which depends on a user-defined
      integer called SEED.  When multiple OpenMP threads are involved, each
      thread should be assigned a different initial value for SEED, in order
      that the threads generate distinct streams of random numbers.  This example
      shows one way that that can be done.
