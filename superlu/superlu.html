    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUPERLU</b>,
      C++ programs which
      illustrate the use of the SUPERLU library
      for the fast direct solution of large sparse systems of linear equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although SUPERLU is written in C, these examples show how
       a C++ program can pass data to SUPERLU
      and receive results computed by it.
    </p>

    <p>
      SUPERLU contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear
      system A*X=B.  It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP).
      The columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the
      preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.
    </p>

    <p>
      SUPERLU is implemented in ANSI C, and must be compiled with
      an ANSI C compiler.  It provides functionality for both real
      and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.  The
      initial letter of a routine name indicates the arithmetic type
      and precision:
      <ul>
        <li>
          C, such as <b>cgstrf</b>, is for single precision complex arithmetic;
        </li>
        <li>
          D, such as <b>dgstrf</b>, is for double precision real arithmetic;
        </li>
        <li>
          S, such as <b>sgstrf</b>, is for single precision real arithmetic;
        </li>
        <li>
          Z, such as <b>zgstrf</b>, is for double precision complex arithmetic.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      SUPERLU includes functions to read a sparse matrix from a file
      in the Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix format.
