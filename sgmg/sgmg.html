      SGMG <br> Sparse Grids, Mixed Factors, Growth Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SGMG</b>
      is a C++ library which
      constructs a sparse grid whose factors are
      possibly distinct 1D quadrature rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SGMG</b> is the successor to the
      <b>SPARSE_GRID_MIXED</b> library.  It includes an option to specify the
      growth rule that converts a level (which indexes the sparse grids)
      to the order (which counts the number of points in a 1D rule.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>SGMG</b> calls many routines from the <b>SANDIA_RULES</b>
      library.  Source code or compiled copies of <i>both</i> libraries must
      be available when a program wishes to use the <b>SGMG</b> library.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that there is a variation of this library which is available, called
      <b>SANDIA_SGMG</b>.  The variant code has the same capabilities, but uses
      a different interface when it calls the functions in <b>SANDIA_RULES</b>
      that generate points and weights of quadrature rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Clenshaw Curtis rule, exponential growth means that
      <ul>
        <li>
          level 0 has order 1;
        </li>
        <li>
          level L has order 2^L+1, for L greater than 0;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For all other rules, exponential growth means that
      <ul>
        <li>
          level L has order 2^(L+1)-1;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For all rules, linear growth means that
      <ul>
        <li>
          level L has order 2*L+1;
        </li>
      </ul>
      Linear growth is <i>not</i> available for the Gauss-Patterson
      rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user controls the growth rate by setting an additional argument
      whose dummy name is <b>level_to_order</b>, and which represents a pointer
      to a function which determines the relationship between the level of
      a 1D quadrature rule and the order, or number of points, that it uses:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>level_to_order_default</b> uses the original exponential growth rate
          for the fully nested rules ("CC", "F2" and "GP"), and a simple
          linear growth rate for other rules ("GL", "GH", "GGH", "LG", "GLG",
          "GJ" and "GW").
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>level_to_order_exponential</b> uses the original exponential growth rate
          for all rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>level_to_order_linear</b> uses the simple
          linear growth rate for all rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The 1D quadrature rules are designed to approximate an integral
      of the form:
      <blockquote><b>
        Integral ( A < X < B ) F(X) W(X) dX
      </b></blockquote>
      where <b>W(X)</b> is a weight function, by the quadrature sum:
      <blockquote><b>
        Sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER) F(X(I)) * W(I)
      </b></blockquote>
      where the set of <b>X</b> values are known as <i>abscissas</i> and
      the set of <b>W</b> values are known as <i>weights</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the letter <b>W</b>, unfortunately, is used to denote both the
      weight function in the original integral, and the vector of weight
      values in the quadrature sum.

      For a given family, a growth rule can be prescribed, which determines
      the orders O of the sequence of rules selected from the family.  The
      selected rules are indexed by L, which starts at 0.  The polynomial precision P
      of the rule is sometimes used to determine the appropriate order O.

    <p>
      A sparse grid is a quadrature rule for a multidimensional integral.
      It is formed by taking a certain linear combination of lower-order
      product rules.  The product rules, in turn, are formed as direct products
      of 1D quadrature rules.  It is common to form a sparse grid in which the
      1D component quadrature rules are the same.  This package, however,
      is intended to produce sparse grids based on sums of product rules for
      which the rule chosen for each spatial dimension may be freely chosen
      from the set listed above.
    </p>

    <p>
      These sparse grids are still indexed by a number known as <b>level</b>,
      and assembled as a sum of low order product rules.  As the value of
      <b>level</b> increases, the point growth becomes more complicated.
      This is because the 1D rules have somewhat varying point growth patterns
      to begin with, and the varying levels of nestedness have a dramatic
      effect on the sparsity of the total grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since a sparse grid is made up of a combination of product grids,
      it is frequently the case that many of the product grids include the
      same point.  For efficiency, it is usually desirable to merge or
      consolidate such duplicate points when expressing the resulting
      sparse grid rule.  It is possible to "logically" determine when
      a duplicate point will be generated; however, this logic changes
      depending on the specific 1-dimensional rules being used, and the
      tests can become quite elaborate.  Moreover, for rules which include
      real parameters, the determination of duplication can require
      a numerical tolerance.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to simplify the matter of the detection of duplicate points,
      the codes presented begin by generating the entire "naive" set of
      points.  Then a user-specified tolerance <b>TOL</b> is used to determine when
      two points are equal.  If the maximum difference between any two components
      is less than or equal to <b>TOL</b>, the points are declared to be equal.
    </p>

    <p>
      A reasonable value for <b>TOL</b> might be the square root of the machine
      precision.  Setting <b>TOL</b> to zero means that only points which are
      identical to the last significant digit are taken to be duplicates.  Setting
      <b>TOL</b> to a negative value means that no duplicate points will be eliminated -
      in other words, this choice produces the full or "naive" grid.
    </p>

      Golub Welsch Rules
    </h3>

    <p>
      A multidimensional sparse grid rule is defined in terms of the
      1D quadrature rules used in each dimension.  This library provides
      9 such standard rules.  If <b>rule[dim]</b> is between 1 and 9,
      then the appropriate internal routines are called to compute the
      points and weights, and assumptions are also made about the
      growth rate in the rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user may wish to define other quadrature rules, and to combine
      these with the built-in rules.  Such rules are assumed to be generated
      by the Golub Welsch procedure.  To build a sparse grid rule which
      uses a Golub Welsch rule in dimension <b>dim</b>, the user must
      do the following:
    </p>

    <p>
      1) Set <b>rule[dim]=10</b> to indicate that a Golub Welsch rule is
      being used in this dimension.  The user may send parameters to this
      rule by setting <b>np</b> and <b>p</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      2) Write a point function of the form
      <pre>
        void compute_points ( int order, int np, double p[], double points[] )
      </pre>
      which may use np parameter values in the <b>p</b> vector as parameters
      for the rule, computing the points of the rule of order <b>order</b> and
      returning them in the array <b>points[]</b>;
    </p>

    <p>
      3) Write a weight function of the form
      <pre>
        void compute_weights ( int order, int np, double p[], double weights[] )
      </pre>
      which may use np parameter values in the <b>p</b> vector as parameters
      for the rule, computing the weights of the rule of order <b>order</b> and
      returning them in the array <b>weights[]</b>;
    </p>

    <p>
      The program knows a lot about sparse grid rules which are built entirely
      from the predefined internal rules.  On the other hand, if even a single
      component of the sparse grid rule involves a user-defined Golub-Welsch rule,
      there are some things the program does not know how to do.  Generally,
      these are minor issues, but the user should be aware of them.
      In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the function <b>sgmg_write</b> which writes
          files defining a sparse grid rule does not have enough information
          to specify the integration region, the "R" file;
        </li>
        <li>
          one of the test codes checks a sparse grid rule's accuracy by
          summing the weights.  But the test code does not
          know enough about the correct result for such a sum when
          a Golub-Welsch rule is one of the factors of the sparse grid rule;
        </li>
      </ul>
