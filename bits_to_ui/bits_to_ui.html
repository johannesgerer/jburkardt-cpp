    <p>
      <b>BITS_TO_UI</b>
      is a C++ program which
      converts a text file of
      '0' and '1' characters to a binary file of 32 bit integers.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>bits_to_ui</b> <i>input_file</i> <i>output_file</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          processes <i>input_file</i>, a text file containing only the
          characters '0' and '1', and creates <i>output_file</i>,
          in binary format, containing
          the 32-bit integers created by grouping together 32 successive
          "bits" from the input file.  The bits are read from left to
          right, in a sense, so a file whose first 32 characters are
          "11010000000000000000000000000000" will result in the first
          integer being 11.
