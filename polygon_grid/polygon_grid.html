      POLYGON_GRID <br> Grid Points in a Polygon
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>POLYGON_GRID</b>
      is a C++ library which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of a polygon in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program relies on a simple idea in which the "vertex centroid"
      (average of the vertices) is computed, allowing the polygon to be
      triangulated.  Each triangle can then easily be gridded.  The collection
      of triangular grids joins up to form a grid over the polygon, although
      the spacing of the the grid points will vary from triangle to triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program really only works properly for convex polygons.  If the
      polygon is not convex, then the vertex centroid need not lie inside
      the polygon, consequently the grid points may also seem misaligned.
