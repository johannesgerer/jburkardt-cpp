      WRAP2 <br> Break Up Long Lines in a File
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>WRAP2</b>
      is a C++ program which
      reads a file and makes a
      copy in which long lines have been broken up.  A line is "wrapped"
      if its length would exceed a given maximum.  Unlike the <b>WRAP</b>
      program, this program will wrap the line before the maximum length
      is reached, if that will help avoid breaking up words.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>wrap2</b> <i>old</i> <i>new</i> <i>wrap_length</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>old</i> is the file to be modified;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>new</i> is the modified copy of the old file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>wrap_length</i> is the maximum line length in characters.
        </li>
      </ul>
