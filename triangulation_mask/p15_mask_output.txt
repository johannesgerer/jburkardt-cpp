TRIANGULATION_MASK
  C++ version:

  Read a node file of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangulation file of TRIANGLE_NUM
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.

  For each triangle, call a user masking routine
  to see if the triangle should be MASKED (not shown).

  Write new node and triangulation files corresponding
  to the unmasked data only.

  Read the header of "p15_nodes.txt".

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM = 2

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.
