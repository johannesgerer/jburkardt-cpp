      CHEBYSHEV_SERIES <br> Evaluate Chebyshev Series with Derivatives
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CHEBYSHEV_SERIES</b>
      is a C++ library which
      can evaluate a Chebyshev series approximating a function f(x),
      while efficiently computing one, two or three derivatives of the
      series, which approximate f'(x), f''(x), and f'''(x),
      by Manfred Zimmer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this library does not compute a Chebyshev series;
      it assumes that the series has already been computed, and 
      offers an efficient means of evaluating the series and its derivatives
      simultaneously.
