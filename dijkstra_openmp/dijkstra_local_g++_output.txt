DIJKSTRA_OPEN_MP
  C++ version
  Use Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the minimum
  distance from node 0 to each node in a graph,
  given the distances between each pair of nodes.

  Although a very small example is considered, we
  demonstrate the use of OpenMP directives for
  parallel execution.

  Distance matrix:

    0   40   15  Inf  Inf  Inf
   40    0   20   10   25    6

  Inf   25  Inf  Inf    0    8
  Inf    6  Inf  Inf    8    0

  P0: Parallel region begins with 1 threads.

  P0:  First=0  Last=5
  P0: Connecting node 2
  P0: Connecting node 1
  P0: Connecting node 5
  P0: Connecting node 3
  P0: Connecting node 4

  P0: Exiting parallel region.

  Minimum distances from node 0:
