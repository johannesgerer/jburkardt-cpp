      OPENMP <br> C++ Examples of Parallel Programming with OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>OPENMP</b> 
      is a directory of C++ programs which 
      illustrate the use of the OpenMP application program interface
      for carrying out parallel computations in a shared memory environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The directives
      allow the user to mark areas of the code, such as <b>do</b>,
      <b>while</b> or <b>for</b> loops, which are suitable for parallel
      processing.  The directives appear as a special kind of 
      comment, so the program can be compiled and run in serial mode.  
      However, the user can tell the compiler to "notice" the special
      directives, in which case a version of the program will be created 
      that runs in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus the same program can easily be run in serial or parallel mode 
      on a given computer, or run on a computer that does not have 
      <b>OpenMP</b> at all. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>OpenMP</b> is suitable for a <i>shared memory</i> parallel system,
      that is, a situation in which there is a single memory space, and
      multiple processors.  If memory is shared, then typically the number
      of processors will be small, and they will all be on the same
      physical machine.  
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, in a <i>distributed memory</i> system, items of data
      are closely associated with a particular processor.  There may
      be a very large number of processors, and they may be more loosely
      coupled and even on different machines.  Such a system will need
      to be handled with <a href = "../mpi_c/mpi_c.html">MPI</a> or some
      other message passing interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>OpenMP</b> descended in part from the old Cray microtasking 
      directives, so if you've lived long enough to remember those, you 
      will recognize some features.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      C++ Issues
    </h3>

    <p>
      OpenMP includes a number of functions whose type must be declared in
      any program that uses them.  A user program calling OpenMP must have
      the statement
      <pre><b>
        # include &lt;omp.h&gt;
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      "Pretend" Parallelism
    </h3>

    <p>
      <b>OpenMP</b> allows you to "request" any number of threads of execution.
      This is a request, and it's not always a wise request.  If your system has
      four processors available, and they're not busy doing other things, or serving
      other users, maybe 4 threads is what you want.  But you can't guarantee
      you'll get the undivided use of those processors.  Moreover, if you run the
      same program using 1 thread and 4 threads, you may find that using 4 threads
      <i>slows you down</i>, either because you don't actually have 4 processors,
      (so the system has the overhead of pretending to run in parallel), or because
      the processors you have are also busy doing other things.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this reason, it's wise to run the program at least once in single thread mode,
      so you have a benchmark against which to measure the speedup you got (or didn't
      get!) versus the speedup you hoped for.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Compiler Support
    </h3>

    <p>
      The compiler you use must recognize the OpenMP directives in order to produce
      code that will run in parallel.  Here are some of the compilers available that
      support OpenMP:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The GNU compilers <b>gcc/g++</b> (version 4.2 or later) 
          and <b>gfortran</b> (version 2.0 or later).
        </li>
        <li>
          The IBM compilers <b>xlc</b> and <b>xlf</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Intel compilers <b>icc</b>, <b>icpc</b> and <b>ifort</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Portland Group C/C++ and Fortran compilers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sun Studio C/C++ and Fortran95 compilers.
        </li>
      </ul>
