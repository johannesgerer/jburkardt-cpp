      C++_CONDOR <br> C++ Execution Under the CONDOR Batch Queueing System
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>C++_CONDOR</b>
      is a directory of examples which
      demonstrate how a C++ program can be executed on a remote machine
      using the CONDOR batch queueing system.
    </p>

    <p>
      CONDOR allows a user to submit jobs for batch execution on an informal
      cluster composed of various computers that often have idle time.
      Based on information from the user's submission file, CONDOR chooses
      one or more appropriate and available computers, transfers files to the
      target systems, executes the program, and returns data to the user.
    </p>

    <p>
      CONDOR has many features, and its proper use varies from site to site.
      The information in this document was inspired by the CONDOR system 
      supported by the FSU Research Computing Center (RCC).  Some of the
      information therefore is peculiar to this local installation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing to note is that the FSU CONDOR cluster does not have
      a shared file system.  Thus, you should probably imagine that you are
      trying to run your program on a remote machine that might be someone's
      iPhone.  None of your files are there, and if you don't say so, you don't
      even know what kind of processor or operating system you are dealing with!
    </p>

    <p>
      So you are responsible for explaining to CONDOR what files you want to
      transfer to this remote machine, and you must specify whether you have
      any requirements, such as a specific operating system or processor type.
      In particular, when working with a C++ program, you must precompile
      the program on the CONDOR login node, and one of your requirements will
      then be that the remote computer has the same processor and operating
      system as the login node.
    </p>


    <p>
      The information about file transfer and system requirements is all part
      of what is called a CONDOR submission script.  The script is a combination
      of comment lines, which begin with the "#" sign, commands of the form
      "A = B" which set certain options, and a few commands that make things happen.
      A typical script might be called "program.condor".
    </p>

    <p>
      The user and CONDOR interact on a special computer called the CONDOR
      login node or submit node.  The user's files must be transferred there,
      the user's CONDOR submission script must be submitted there, and the
      results from the remote machine will be copied back to this place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user logs into the CONDOR submit node interactively:
      <pre>
        ssh condor-login.rcc.fsu.edu
      </pre>
      There are TWO reasons why this might not work for you, however.
      <ol> 
        <li>
          you must already have a valid RCC account;
        </li>
        <li>
          you must be logged in locally; as far as I can tell, you can't
          log in from home, or another university, or a national lab, for instance;
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      File transfer is done with the SFTP command.
      <pre>
        sftp condor-login.rcc.fsu.edu
          put program.condor
          put mandelbrot.f90
          quit
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      When ready, the CONDOR submission script is sent by the command
    </p>
      <pre>
        condor_submit program.condor
      </pre>
      The user can check on the status of the job with the command
      <pre>
        condor_q
      </pre>
      If all goes well, the job output will be returned to the CONDOR
      submit node.
      However, if things do not go well, or the job is taking too much
      time, user "username" can delete all jobs in the condor queue with 
      the command
      <pre>
        condor_rm username
      </pre>
    </p>

      Using Files:
    </h3>

    <p>
      On the FSU RCC Condor cluster, you must first copy your files to the 
      CONDOR login machine.  When you submit your job to the CONDOR queue,
      however, the program execution will take place on some unknown machine,
      which initially does not have any of your files.  Therefore, an important
      part of using CONDOR is making sure that you copy to the remote machine
      all the files needed for input, including a compiled copy of your C
      program.  Luckily, CONDOR will automatically copy back to the login node
      every file that is created by the program execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the file system is not shared, the following commands should
      appear in your CONDOR script:
      <pre>
        should_transfer_files = yes
        when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
      </pre>
      that allows you to specify the name of this file.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your executable reads from "standard input", (such as the C++ statement
      <pre>
        cin >> i;
      </pre>
      then your CONDOR job will need a file containing that information.  
      CONDOR includes a command of the form
      <pre>
        input = filename
      </pre>
      that allows you to specify the name of this file.  Similarly, if
      your program writes to "standard output", such as the C++ statement
      <pre>
        cout << "The answer is " << 42 << "\n";
      </pre>
      then CONDOR allows you to
      specify the name of a file where this information will go:
      <pre>
        output = filename
      </pre>
      The input file must exist on your CONDOR login node before you submit
      the job.  The output file is created during the run, and
      will automatically be copied back to your CONDOR login node when the
      job is completed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your job may require other data files to run than simply the standard
      input file.  If so, you need to tell CONDOR the names of these files, in a 
      comma-separated list:
      <pre>
        transfer_input_files = file1, file2, ..., file99
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Your job may create many files aside from simply standard output.
      Luckily, all files created by the run will be automatically copied back.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are going to compile the C executable on the CONDOR login node,
      but run it on some other remote machine.  Therefore, we need the following
      command to guarantee that the remote machine can understand the executable:
      <pre>
        requirements = ( OpSYS="LINUX" &amp;&amp; Arch=="X86_64 )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that the C++ program we want to run is named "mandelbrot.cpp".
      We compile this program on the CONDOR login node with commands like
      <pre>
        g++ mandelbrot.cpp -lm
        mv a.out mandelbrot
      </pre>
      which creates an executable program called "mandelbrot".
      This program must be copied to the remote machine,
      so your CONDOR script must include the statement:
      <pre>
        executable = mandelbrot
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      A Sample CONDOR Script
    </h3>

    <p>
      Here is a file called "mandelbrot.condor" which ought to be able to run
      our compiled program somewhere, and return the results to us:
      <pre>
        universe = vanilla
        executable = mandelbrot
        arguments =
        input =
        requirements = ( OpSYS="LINUX" &amp;&amp; Arch=="X86_64 )
        should_transfer_files = yes
        when_to_transfer_files = on_exit
        notification = never
        output = mandelbrot_output.txt
        log = mandelbrot_log.txt
        queue
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A few comments are in order.  
      <ul>
        <li>
          The "universe" command is required,
          and on the FSU CONDOR system, we only have the "vanilla" universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "arguments" command allows you to pass commandline arguments to
          the executable program.
        </li>
        <li>
          Setting "notification" to "yes" will cause CONDOR to send you
          email when the job completes, and perhaps at some other stages as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "log" command species a name to use for the file in which CONDOR
          records the progress of the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "error" command allows you to capture output to standard error.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "queue" command is necessary, and tells CONDOR to actually
          begin running your job.
        </li>
      </ul>
