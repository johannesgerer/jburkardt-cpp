MANDELBROT
  C++ version

  Create an ASCII PPM image of the Mandelbrot set.

  For each point C = X + i*Y
  with X range [-2.25,1.25]
  and  Y range [-1.75,1.75]
  carry out 400 iterations of the map
  Z(n+1) = Z(n)^2 + C.
  If the iterates stay bounded (norm less than 2)
  then C is taken to be a member of the set.

  An ASCII PPM image of the set is created using
    N = 501 pixels in the X direction and
    N = 501 pixels in the Y direction.

  ASCII PPM image data stored in "mandelbrot.ppm".

  Normal end of execution.
