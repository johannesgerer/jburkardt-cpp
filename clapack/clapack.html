      CLAPACK <br> C Translation of BLAS and LAPACK
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CLAPACK</b>
      is a C++ program which
      illustrates the use of CLAPACK,
      a C translation of the FORTRAN77 BLAS and LAPACK linear algebra libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
      By translating the LAPACK library into C, several important linear algebra
      operations were made available in efficient, reliable versions, including:
      <ul>
        <li>
          solution of linear systems A*x=b;
        </li>
        <li>
          the QR factorization of a (possibly rectangular) matrix, A = Q*R,
          as a product of an orthogonal matrix Q and upper triangular matrix R.
        </li>
        <li>
          the SVD factorization of a (possibly rectangular) matrix, A = U*S*V',
          as a product of an orthogonal matrix U, a diagonal matrix S, and
          an orthogonal matrix V.
        </li>
        <li>
          the computation of the condition number, determinant, or inverse
          of a square matrix A.
        </li>
        <li>
          the eigenvalue decomposition of a square matrix A, A*X=X*LAMBDA,
          where the columns of X are eigenvectors, and LAMBDA is a diagonal
          matrix of eigenvalues.
        </li>
        <li>
          the Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric positive definite matrix
          A = L * L' = R' * R, where L is a lower triangular matrix, and R
          an upper triangular matrix.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The translation was done using the automatic F2C translator.  As a 
      consequence, the resulting C source code is at best unpleasant to read.
      Moreover, the user's C code must be written and processed in a particular
      way.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the user code must have the necessary "include" statements.
      Usually, this means adding the statements:
      <pre>
        # include "blaswrap.h"
        # include "f2c.h"
        # include "clapack.h"
      </pre>
      Note that, for convenience, on the Department of Scientific Computing
      classroom system, it is enough to say simply
      <pre>
        # include "clapack.h"
      </pre>
      because the three include files have been merged into one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, all variables that will be passed to a CLAPACK function
      must be declared using types that can be handled by the FORTRAN
      package.  In general, this only affects integer variables; as a rule
      this means that if PIV is an integer scalar, vector or array that will
      be passed to CLAPACK, its type must be either "integer" (a type defined
      by f2c.h), or else as "long int" (a standard C type).  Declaring such
      a variable as "int" will not work!
    </p>

    <p>
      Each user accessible routine in the FORTRAN version of LAPACK 
      has a corresponding CLAPACK version.  However, to access the CLAPACK 
      version, the user must specify the name of the routine in lower case
      letters only, and must append an underscore to the name.  Thus,
      to access a LAPACK routine such as DGETRF(), the user's C code must
      look something like this:
      <pre>
        dgetrf_ ( <i>list of arguments</i> )
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Because all FORTRAN subroutine arguments can be modified during the
      execution of the subroutine, the CLAPACK interface requires that
      every argument in the argument list must be modifiable.  In cases
      where a vector or array is being passed, this happens automatically.
      However, when passing a scalar variable, such as "N", the size of 
      the linear system, or "LDA", the leading dimension of array A,
      or "INFO", an error return flag, it is necessary to prefix the name
      with an ampersand.  Thus, a call to DGESV() might look like:
      <pre>
        dgesv_ ( &n, &nrhs, a, &lda, ipiv, b, &ldb, &info );
      </pre>
      because <b>n</b>, <b>nrhs</b>, <b>lda</b>, <b>ldb</b> and <b>info</b> 
      are scalar variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vector and matrix arguments to the CLAPACK routine don't require 
      the ampersand.  Moreover, vectors (singly indexed lists of numbers)
      essentially work the same in C and FORTRAN, so it's not difficult
      to correctly set up vector arguments for CLAPACK.  However, matrices
      (doubly indexed sets of data) are handled differently, and the user's
      C code must either set up the data in a FORTRAN way immediately, or
      else set it up in a way natural to C and then convert the data to make
      a FORTRAN copy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's assume that we have an M by N set of data, and to be concrete,
      let's consider an example where M = 3 and N = 2.  In C, it would be
      natural to declare this data as follows:
      <pre>
        double a[3][2] = {
          { 11, 12 },
          { 21, 22 },
          { 31, 32 } };
      </pre>
      In this case, the (I,J) entry (using 0-based indexing) 
      can be retrieved as <b>a[i][j]</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, FORTRAN essentially stores a matrix as a vector, in which
      the data is stored on column at a time.  Thus, if we wished to pass
      the example data to CLAPACK as an array, we might instead use the following
      declaration:
      <pre>
        double b[3*2] = {
          11, 21, 31,
          12, 22, 32 };
      </pre>
      In this case, the (I,J) entry (using 0-based indexing) can be retrieved 
      as <b>b[i+j*3]</b> where the number 3 is the "leading dimension" of the 
      array, that is, the length of one column.
    </p>

    <p>
      But suppose we need to build the array using the double indexed version,
      although we know we have to pass a single indexed copy to CLAPACK?
      Then we can start with the following declarations:
       <pre>
        double a[3][2];
        double b[3*2];
      </pre>
      and calculate the entries of <b>a</b> using double indexing, and then
      copy the information into <b>b</b> using code like the following:
      <pre>
        for ( j = 0; j < 2; j++ )
        {
          for ( i = 0; i < 3; i++ )
          {
            b[i+j*3] = a[i][j];
          }
        }
      </pre>
      after which, the vector <b>b</b> will contain a copy of the data that
      is in <b>a</b>, suitable for use by CLAPACK.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both LAPACK and CLAPACK allow you to store M by N data inside arrays
      of larger size.  In that case, the actual first dimension of the 
      double dimensioned array is called the "leading dimension", and its
      value must be available whenever entries of the smaller array must 
      be located inside the bigger array.  I will assume for now that you
      always make your arrays exactly big enough to hold the data you are
      interested in.  Typically, this will mean that the variables LDA and
      LDB are equal to N.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you think you've got your user code all set up, you need to compile
      and load your program.  Compilation requires access to a copy of the
      CLAPACK include file, and that depends on how CLAPACK was installed on
      your system.  For our local system, the include file is stored in
      /usr/common/clapack, so the compile statement might be
      <pre>
        gcc -I/usr/common/clapack myprog.c
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The load procedure requires access to the CLAPACK library.  For
      our local system, the library is stored as libclapack.a in 
      /usr/local/common, and so the load statement is:
      <pre>
        gcc myprog.o -L/usr/common/clapack -lclapack -lm
      </pre>
      which should create an executable program.
    </p>

      The source code for the CLAPACK library is available from
      <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/clapack">
                 http://www.netlib.org/clapack </a>.
      Actually setting up the library for use can be surprisingly
      awkward and failure-prone.
