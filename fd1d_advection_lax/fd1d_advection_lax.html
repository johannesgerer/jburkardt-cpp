      Finite Difference Method<br> 
      1D Advection Equation<br>
      Lax Method
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_ADVECTION_LAX</b> 
      is a C++ program which
      applies the finite difference method to solve the time-dependent
      advection equation ut = - c * ux in one spatial dimension, with
      a constant velocity, using the Lax method for the time derivative,
      writing graphics files for processing by gnuplot.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lax method is an improvement to the FTCS method.  The FTCS method is
      always unstable; nonphysical oscillations appear and grow.  The Lax method
      is stable, if the time step is small enough; however, it does cause the 
      wave to gradually spread out and flatten.
    </p>

    <p>
      We solve the constant-velocity advection equation in 1D,
      <pre>
        du/dt = - c du/dx
      </pre>
      over the interval:
      <pre>
        0.0 <= x <= 1.0
      </pre>
      with periodic boundary conditions, and
      with a given initial condition
      <pre>
        u(0,x) = (10x-4)^2 (6-10x)^2 for 0.4 <= x <= 0.6
               = 0 elsewhere.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lax method modifies the FTCS approximation to the time derivative:
      <ul>
        <li>
          du/dt = (u(t+dt,x)-0.5*u(t,x-dx)-0.5*u(t,x+dx))/dt
        </li>
        <li>
          du/dx = (u(t,x+dx)-u(t,x-dx))/2/dx
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For our simple case, the advection velocity is constant
      in time and space.  Therefore, (given our periodic boundary conditions),
      the solution should simply move smoothly from left to right, returning
      on the left again.  Unlike in the case of the FTCS approach, we do not
      see unstable oscillations.  However, instead, we definitely find the
      wave gradually flattening out.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are more sophisticated methods for the advection problem,
      which do not exhibit this behavior.
