      SUBSET_SUM_SERIAL <br>
      Solve a Subset Sum Problem by Exhaustive Search
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SUBSET_SUM_SERIAL</b>
      is a C++ library which
      illustrates how a subset sum problem can be solved by exhaustive search.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are given a collection of (21) weights and a
      <i>target value</i> (24639098).  We seek a combination of the weights which
      adds up to the target value.
    </p>

    <p>
      The function <i>subset_sum_serial.m</i> simply considers every possible subset of the
      weights, determines its sum, and compares that to the target value.  The
      first case in which the target value is matched is returned as the solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program, which solves the problem serially, is primarily intended to
      be a starting point for a parallel programming approach.
