TET_MESH_BOUNDARY
  C++ version
  Read files defining a tet mesh dataset.

  Determine the faces that form the boundary;
  write a boundary node mask file;
  write a boundary node file;
  write a boundary element file,
  defining the boundary as a TRI_SURFACE.

  Compiled on Dec 22 2010 at 15:55:07.

  Read the header of "cube_nodes.txt".

  Spatial dimension = 3
  Number of nodes   = 8

  Read the data in "cube_nodes.txt".

  First 5 nodes:

  Row:       1             2             3       
  Col
    1              0             0             0
    2              0             0             1

    5              1             0             0

  Read the header of "cube_elements.txt".

  Element order = 4
  Number of tetras  = 6

  Read the data in "cube_elements.txt".

  First 5 elements:

  Row:      1       2       3       4  
  Col

    1       4       3       5       1  
    2       4       2       5       1  
    3       4       7       3       5

    5       4       6       2       5  

MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based.
  This will be converted to 0-based.

  Number of faces is 24
  Number of boundary faces is 12
  Number of boundary nodes is 8

  Wrote the boundary node coordinates to "cube_boundary_nodes.txt".
  Wrote the boundary node mask to "cube_boundary_node_mask.txt".
  Wrote the boundary face coordinates to "cube_boundary_elements.txt".

TET_MESH_BOUNDARY:
  Normal end of execution.
