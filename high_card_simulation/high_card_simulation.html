      HIGH_CARD_SIMULATION <br> Guessing What the Highest Card Is
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HIGH_CARD_SIMULATION</b>
      is a C++ program which
      simulates a game in which you have one chance to select the highest card
      from a deck, using GNUPLOT to display the estimated and exact probabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are given a deck of DECK_SIZE cards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your goal is to select the high card.  For convenience, we can assume 
      the cards are a permutation of the integers from 1 to DECK_SIZE, but in
      fact the user mustn't see such values or else it's obvious which is the
      largest card.  (For a truly difficult problem, we'd have to work harder
      to disguise the range of values and the likely distribution!)
    </p>

    <p>
      Your choice is made under the following rules:  You may turn over
      one card at a time.  When a card is turned over, you may declare that to be
      your choice, or else turn over another card.  If you have not chosen a card
      by the end, then your choice is the final card.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have no idea what to do, and simply decide in advance to pick
      a card "at random", that is, for example, you decide to pick the 15th card
      before having seen any cards, then your probability of winning is 1/DECK_SIZE.
    </p>

    <p>
      The question is, can you do better than that?
    </p>

    <p>
      A good strategy is as follows: always look at the first SKIP_NUM cards
      without choosing them.  Then choose the very next card you encounter 
      that is larger than the cards you skipped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this program, you can easily see that skipping 5 cards is much better
      than picking one at random, skipping 10 is even better, and so on...up to some
      point, when the benefit begins to disappear.  Of course,
      you can't skip too many cards, and in fact, the results seem to be best for
      somewhere around 30 to 35 cards skipped.  For problems like this, the
      optimal value is somewhere around 1 / e, where E is the base of the natural
      logarithm system.
