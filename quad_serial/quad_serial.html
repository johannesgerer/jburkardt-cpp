      QUAD_SERIAL <br> Estimate an Integral
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUAD_SERIAL</b>
      is a C++ program which
      estimates an integral by using an averaging technique.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is intended as a starting point;
      both MPI and OpenMP can be used to make a parallel version.
