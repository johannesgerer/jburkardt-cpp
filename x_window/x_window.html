      X_WINDOW <br> Examples of X Window Programming
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>X_WINDOW</b>
      is a directory of C++ programs which
      demonstrate the use of the X Window system which
      allows the creation and control of windows on a
      remote computer terminal.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might imagine that the X Window library is a simple set of
      routines that any user can call to set up interactive graphics.
      It isn't.  The X Window library is complicated and cumbersome.
      The beginner is advised to take a working copy of an X Window
      program and proceed slowly and cautiously to try to understand
      how it works.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, there are many useful programs available
      which use the X Window library.  In that case, the user may
      only need to know a few facts about X Window programs in order
      to have a satisfactory experience.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you do run an X windows program, it's often the case that
      the program is running on a "big" machine (the server) that you've
      logged into from your "home" machine (the client).  The big machine
      is going to want to display graphics on your home machine, but this
      will not happen automatically!  For this to actually happen properly,
      two things must be true:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The "home" machine must give permission to the "big" machine
          to mess with its screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "big" machine must know where to send the graphics.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are lucky, your terminal software may automatically
      have set up the permissions and addresses for you.  In particular,
      if you are using <b>ssh</b>, you should be able to get things
      to work nicely, once you enable X11 forwarding.  Running <b>ssh</b>
      on a PC means you may have to go into a menu in order to enable
      this.  On a Unix machine, you need to have an <b>ssh</b> <i>config</i>
      file; if it's not in the right place, you can get a copy and put
      it in the right place by the command:
      <pre>
        cp /etc/ssh/ssh_config $HOME/.ssh/config
      </pre>
      and then make sure that your <i>config</i> file includes the line
      <pre>
        ForwardX11 yes
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      If your terminal software does not set up permissions for you,
      you may need to enter specific commands to make this happen.
      <ol>
        <li>
          In order for your "home" machine to allow the "big" machine
          to send graphics to its screen, you may need to type
          the following command on your home machine:
          <blockquote>
            <b>xhost +</b> <i>big_machine</i>
          </blockquote>
          where <i>big_machine</i> is the Internet address of the big machine.
        </li>
        <li>
          To tell the "big" machine where to send the graphics, type
          a command like this on the big machine:
          <blockquote>
            <b>setenv DISPLAY</b> <i>home_machine</i><b>:0.0</b>
          </blockquote>
          where, again, <i>home_machine</i> is the Internet address of your
          home machine, where you want the graphics to appear.  If you
          don't know the Internet address of your home machine, you might
          try the command
          <blockquote>
            <b>hostname --long</b>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Assuming that you are able to figure out how get an X Window
      program to run, you may also be interested in being able to
      predefine certain properties of your X Window session.  These
      can include preferred fonts, screen size, or the shape of the
      icon.  Such attributes can be controlled by placing a file
      called <b>.Xdefaults</b> in your home directory.  This file is
      automatically read by an X Window program, and the information
      found in there may be used to customize the program to your
      requests.
