      TREEPACK <br> Computations using Tree Graphs
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TREEPACK</b>
      is a C++ library which
      performs common calculations involving a special kind of graph
      known as a tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      A graph is a collection of objects or "nodes", such that any (unordered) pair of
      nodes is connected or not connected.  If a pair of nodes <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>
      are connected, we say there is an "edge" between them, and we may describe
      the edge as <b>(i,j)</b>.  A graph can be represented by a drawing
      of dots with lines connecting some of the dots.
    </p>

    <p>
      A tree is a minimally connected graph; more precisely, it is a graph
      with two additional properties:
      <ul>
        <li>
          it is <i>connected</i>, that is, given any two pair of nodes <b>i</b>
          and <b>j</b>, there is a sequence of edges <b>(na,nb),(nb,nc),...(nx,ny),(ny,nz)</b>
          such that <b>na=i</b> and <b>nz=j</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          if any edge is removed from the graph, it is no longer connected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Note that a tree using <b>N</b> nodes will have exactly <b>N-1</b> edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several ways to represent a graph on the computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_ARC</b> representation, we simply store a list of the edges
      of the tree, that is, pairs of nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_PRUEFER</b> representation, a tree of <b>N</b> nodes 
      is represented by a sequence of <b>N-2</b> integers known as the
      Pruefer code.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_PARENT</b> representation, a tree of <b>N</b> nodes 
      is represented by a list of nodes PARENT, such that, for I = 1 to N - 1,
      the I-th edge of the tree connects node I to node PARENT(I).
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_ROOTED</b> representation, a tree is assumed to have the additional
      property that one node has been designated as the "root".
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_RB</b> representation, a tree is assumed to have the additional
      properties that one node has been designated as the "root", and that every node 
      has exactly 1 or 2 edges.
