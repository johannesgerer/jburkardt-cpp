    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PYRAMID_GRID</b>
      is a C++ library which
      generates a grid of points
      over the interior of a pyramid in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pyramid has a square base.  As it rises, the square cross
      section smoothly shrinks to a point.  Thus there are five vertices,
      of which four are on the square base, and one is the apex.  There
      are 8 edges, consisting of the four edges of the square, and an
      edge joining each base vertex to the apex vertex.
    </p>

    <p>
       The unit pyramid is the set of points (X,Y,Z) such that:
       <pre>
       - ( 1 - Z ) <= X <= 1 - Z
       - ( 1 - Z ) <= Y <= 1 - Z
                 0 <= Z <= 1.
       </pre>
    </p>
